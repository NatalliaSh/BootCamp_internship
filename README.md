# IT Bootcamp: BootcampBoard project
## Personal work results

This repository contains code that I’ve developed during my internship at IT Bootcamp.

The project is commercial and I have the right to publish only that part of the code that I developed myself.
Therefore, you won’t be able to run this code: the application will not work, because here are only code excerpts.
But you can look at the code and evaluate the quality of the work I have done.

Thank you for your attention!
